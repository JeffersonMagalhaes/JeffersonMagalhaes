# Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 

## About Me
I am a Data Analyst with a unique blend of experience in marketing, product development, customer experience, and customer support. As a professor of data analysis, I'm deeply committed to the idea that data can create real value and transform personal and professional outcomes.
In my professional journey, I leverage statistics and business acumen to answer pertinent questions for stakeholders. My toolkit includes Python, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, R, and Excel, which I use to translate data into actionable insights.
